# Exercise: Say Hello and Track Progress

Use what you saw in `example.py` to build your own short learning diary script.

## Requirements

1. Print a welcome message for yourself.
2. Store your name and number of Python lessons finished in variables.
3. Display both pieces of information in a sentence using an f-string.
4. Update the number of lessons finished by one and print the new total.
5. Add at least two helpful comments explaining your thought process.

## Tips

- Keep variable names descriptive: `user_name` or `lessons_done` are clearer than `x`.
- Remember that Python runs top to bottom, so define variables before using them.
- Use `print()` with no arguments if you want to insert a blank line between sections.
- Try running your script multiple times and changing the numbers to see different outputs.
