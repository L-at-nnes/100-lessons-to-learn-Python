# 100 Lessons to Learn Python

A structured roadmap to learn Python in approachable, bite-sized lessons. The goal is to publish one lesson per day (or every two days) on GitHub so learners can follow a consistent, motivating path to mastery.

---

## What You'll Find

Each lesson tackles one concept through a mix of explanation, guided practice, and reflection. By following the sequence you will:

- Build solid Python fundamentals before moving to advanced topics.
- Practice daily in small increments to keep your momentum.
- Learn idiomatic, readable Python with real-world patterns.
- Ship meaningful progress to your GitHub profile with every lesson.

---

## Lesson Format

Every lesson lives in its own folder and follows the naming convention `Lesson n°XX - topic/`. Feel free to adapt the names if needed, but the learning experience stays the same:

```
Lesson n°XX - topic/
├── example.py   # Narrative code + extensive inline commentary
├── exercise.md  # Practice task with hints and tips
└── solution.py  # Fully commented walkthrough of the answer
```

This consistent template keeps things predictable for learners and makes contributions easy to review.

## 100-Lesson Roadmap

### Days 1-20 · Foundations
Variables, primitive types, operators, input/output, control flow, strings, slicing, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and an introduction to functions.

### Days 21-40 · Intermediate Concepts
Comprehensive function patterns (`*args`, `**kwargs`, scope), modules and imports, error handling, file I/O (text, JSON, CSV), iterators, generators, comprehensions, and decorators.

### Days 41-60 · Object-Oriented Programming
Classes, instances, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, magic methods, abstract base classes, dataclasses, enums, slots, type hints, and a capstone OOP mini-project.

### Days 61-80 · Advanced Python
Core libraries (`math`, `random`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `os`, `sys`, `time`, `statistics`), environments, package management, HTTP requests, XML, regex, logging, CLI tooling with `argparse`, multiprocessing, threading, async, and profiling.

### Days 81-100 · Practical Applications
Architecting projects, CLI tools, SQLite, Pandas, Matplotlib, REST APIs, automation, emailing, testing & mocking, FastAPI, packaging, and a final multi-concept project.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo and open the next lesson folder in order.
2. Read `example.py` to understand the concept with guided commentary.
3. Work through `exercise.md` using the embedded hints if you get stuck.
4. Compare your work to `solution.py`, focusing on the reasoning as much as the final code.
5. Commit the lesson to GitHub (daily or every other day) to keep your streak alive.
